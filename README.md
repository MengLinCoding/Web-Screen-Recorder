<p align="center"> Why is screen recording so frustrating? </p>
<p align="center"> Downloading OBS or Zoom is overkill. </p>
<p align="center"> Too many pay as you go recorders online. </p>
<p align="center"> Maybe all you need is a simple downloadable web-app... </h>

## Issues
* When recording is stopped and user refuses to save, the save files window is still activated. The process can be simplified by removing the need to promp a name for the file.
* Does not prompt for permission to record screen on android phone.
* Does not open file saver when recording is stopped on Safari.
